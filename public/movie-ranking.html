<h1>The most AWESOME movies ever, according to Anna</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time!</h2>

<h3>Lord of the Rings trilogy</h3>
<p>This trilogy will always have a top place in my heart, jeez, so much laughter, tears and pulse!<br /> 
    I knew all the lines, and I even learned elvish. And all my room-walls were plastered with images of Aragorn ofc.</p>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>This one comes at a close second. The magic of Pandora, who wouldn't want to live there?</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park (ALL OF THEM!!)</h3>
